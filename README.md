# Bharat-Intern_of_SMS__Spam-Classifier
Our project represents the culmination of extensive work in harnessing data science techniques within the Python ecosystem
The "SMS Spam Classifier" project is like a smart filter for text messages. Its job is to tell if a message is spam (unwanted or potentially harmful) or not. It does this by learning from a bunch of examples of spam and regular messages.

First, it looks at a collection of messages, some spam, some not. Then, it teaches itself to understand the difference between them. It changes the words in the messages into numbers so it can understand them better.

After that, it uses a common method called Multinomial Naive Bayes to learn from these numbers. This helps it to predict whether new messages are likely spam or not.

To check how well it's doing, we test it with more messages it hasn't seen before. We measure how often it gets it right using something called accuracy.

Finally, you can use it yourself! You can give it your own messages to see if it thinks they're spam or not, giving you quick feedback.

So, basically, this project helps keep your messages safe by spotting and filtering out spam, making your communication experience better and safer.
